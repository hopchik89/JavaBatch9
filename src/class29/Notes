Variables
They hold data
    1) one value at a time what if we need to store more data we will have to declare
    that many variables not feasible.
Arrays:
Consecutive memory location pointed by a single variable
    1) Fixed in size once the array is declared we can not change the size
    2) If we declare a bigger array at the start we may be wasting memory
    3) if we declare a smaller array we have to do a lot of work to accommodate
    entries beyond the size of the array
To Rescue we have Collection framework in java
Collections Framework
is a collection of classes and interfaces that can hold objects as a single unit
like arrays but with a lot flexibility.
