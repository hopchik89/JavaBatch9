Four Pillars of OOPS
1) Inheritance
2) Polymorphism
3) Abstraction
4) Encapsulation
Inheritance:
It is a mechanism that allows to inherit properties and methods from one class to other class
to avoid duplication we use extends keyword to inherit from one class.
2) Polymorphism
Capability of a method to do different things based on obj that is acting upon
same method can act in many different forms we do not to come up with different names
everytime we need slightly different behaviour
we can achieve polymorphism through method overloading and method overriding
3) Abstraction
Abstraction is a process of hiding implementation details and showing
only functionality to the user. Abstraction is what an Object does instead of how it
does it
Parent class we only define how the method will look like
    1)what the method will return
    2)what will be the name of the method
    3) how many and which type of arguments it will take
Child class now provides the implementation
Rules for abstract class:
    1) we can not create the object of the abstract classes
    2) we can not decease the visibility of the access modifier
    3) Child class must define the abstract methods or it should be declared as abstract
We can also achieve Interfaces:
